# Kafka and Spark Streaming

We'll need some Spark stuff:

```bash
$ brew install hadoop
$ brew install apache-spark
```

```bash
$ ls -las /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop
total 0
0 drwxr-xr-x    3 davidainslie  admin    96 30 May 22:39 .
0 drwxr-xr-x  243 davidainslie  admin  7776 30 May 22:40 ..
0 drwxr-xr-x   10 davidainslie  admin   320 30 May 22:40 3.1.2
```

Add to your profile e.g. .zshrc:

```properties
export HADOOP_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/3.1.2
export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=$HADOOP_HOME/libexec/etc/hadoop
```

and **source** it.

Check it:

```bash
$ spark-shell --conf spark.ui.port=12901

## Spark Streaming

Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Kinesis, or TCP sockets, and can be processed using complex algorithms expressed with high-level functions like `map`, `reduce`, `join` and `window`. Finally, processed data can be pushed out to filesystems, databases, and live dashboards.

Internally, it works as follows. Spark Streaming receives live input data streams and divides the data into batches, which are then processed by the Spark engine to generate the final stream of results in batches.

## DStreams

**Discretized Stream** or **DStream** is the basic abstraction provided by Spark Streaming. It represents a continuous stream of data, either the input data stream received from source, or the processed data stream generated by transforming the input stream. Internally, a DStream is represented by a continuous series of RDDs, which is Sparkâ€™s abstraction of an immutable, distributed dataset. Each RDD in a DStream contains data from a certain interval:
